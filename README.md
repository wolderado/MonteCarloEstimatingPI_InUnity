The thing I've found is that it's extremely sensetive to precision and the quality of the seed. Since we can't use real randomness, I think the estimation can only be so accurate.

It could be more accurate or display the data in a better way but I'm happy with the results. I just wanted to see the method in action and I find the results really cool
